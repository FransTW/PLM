									<h1>Product Life Cycle Management</h1>
									<p>Group 1 - interactive report</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									The main focus of the assignment is to use a project lifecycle management (PLM) software to organise the project. The PLM software that is used is 3dexperience from D’assualt systeme. The assignment’s secondary objective is to re-design a wind turbine from the scenario that could happen within an engineering company. <br>
									The steps that are taken in the PLM software are based on the scenario that is represented in the Figure seen below. This picture explains that steps should be taken and who should approve different actions to make sure that the right people get informed with the information that they need for their part of the project. During this report, the structure will be explained to show how it is implemented within this project.

								<h3>Scenario</h3>

								<h3>Roles</h3>
								<p>The wind turbine is in need for both improved blades and an improved yaw system. Both these issues are raised and, therefore need to go through the PLM process step-by-step to make sure that the right people make and approve changes. For this project, the process will be done by four people which are assigned different roles. These roles can be seen in the table below.</p>

							<h3>Mark up</h3>
							<p>
								First of all, an issue is raised by either an engineer, expert or product manager. In this project, the issues were raised by the project leader, after which the issues where further explored and routed to the experts that are involved, so that these experts can write impact analysis.
								<br>
								In this project, the issue is first seen in the 3D markup space, where comments can be placed in the spots that should be changed. This is helpful for everyone involved so that it can be made sure that the same issue is being discussed.

								<h3>Gantt chart</h3>
								<p>
									If the issues seem to be important, by reading the impact analysis and approval from the CEO and other management, the project leader starts with making a Gantt Chart. This chart explains in detail the steps and that should be taken to complete this project. During the project, the progress is being checked continuously to make sure that no part is lacking. This should be done on time so that there will always be time to repair issues or problems.

								<h3>Impact analysis</h3>
								<p>
									The change manager organizes that impact analysis and makes sure that the right files are send to the right expert. These experts are than asked to all give valuable insights on what a possible change could mean for the product and/or company from their perspective.  
								</p>

								<h4>Approval routing</h4>
								<p>
									After all impact analysis have been written by experts, the change owner should approve the impact analysis, only based on if all analysis have been written. The project leader has a more in-depth look at the analysis and makes the first decision if the impact of changing the product is worth the risk.
									<br>
									The final approval should come from the manager with the authority to do so. All risks and will have to be weighed against the potential benefits.

								<p>
									The process is now completely approved, and gets started according to the planning. To get started, the final step in the set-up process should be done; making a change order. Two change orders are made, one for the blade optimalization and one for the yaw system. Both these change orders contain design, mechanical and simulation change actions.

								<p>
									These change actions are linked to the specific engineer who should perform the task. When the engineer is done with its part, it is send for approval to both an expert in the specific domain and afterwards to the project lead. 
									<br>
									According to the planning, the order of the change actions should first be the design, then mechanical and lastly, the simulation. This can however, be changed since the process is an iterative process that might need different versions.

								<h3>Blade design</h3>
								<p>
									The main goal of the blade re-design is to make it more efficient, this can be done by improving the aerodynamics of the blade. The design engineer’s sketch focuses on improving the cross-section of the blade, the shape is inspired on a water droplet shape. Since the overall shape of the blade will the changed, the connection to the rest of the assembly should be changed as well, this concept is also worked out in the sketch.

								<h3>Blade simulation</h3>

								<p>
									A flow simulation was performed to evaluate the proposed design changes. The simulation was initially conducted on the baseline blade design, and these results served as a comparative guideline for the simulation of the proposed design. The flow simulation on the proposed design revealed a reduction in drag forces and an increase in lift forces. The detailed results, including drag and lift coefficients, can be seen in Table ...
								</p>
								
								<h3>Yaw design</h3>

								<p>
									The yaw system of the current wind turbine gives too much friction, this is an issue due to the wear of the metal pieces and losing energy. The new concept from the design engineer shows a possible solution by including a bearing in the design. This, so called, thrust bearing is placed between the axle and the nacelle to reduce friction that causes by the rotating pieces. The axle has been re-designed, to accommodate for the bearing. The length of the axle has increased and the width of the flange has been widened, both these changes make sure that the bearing fits on the axle.

										</div>
									</div>
								</section>

								<h3>Yaw motion study</h3>

								<p>
									A motion study has been performed by the engineer to check if all parts fit and to see if the required rotating has been designed as intended.  The study shows that the changes, in theory, should perform as designed. After the simulation has been approved, the technical drawings can be sent to the manufacturer to find out if the changes could also work in practice.
