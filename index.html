				<p>
					The main focus of the assignment is to use a project lifecycle management (PLM) software to organise
					the project. The PLM software that is used is 3dexperience from D’assualt systeme. The assignment’s
					secondary objective is to re-design a wind turbine from the scenario that could happen within an
					engineering company. <br>
					The steps that are taken in the PLM software are based on the scenario that is represented in the
					Figure seen below. This picture explains that steps should be taken and who should approve different
					actions to make sure that the right people get informed with the information that they need for
					their part of the project. During this report, the structure will be explained to show how it is
					implemented within this project.

				<h3>Scenario</h3>
				<p>
					We are a company that develops and sells wind turbines, manufacturing is outsourced.
					A wind turbine is currently released onto the market but needs improvements to the wind blades and yaw.
					One of the project managers raises issues on different parts of these assemblies and proposes a redesign of the blades and yaw.
					This process will be executed by an internal design team making use of the full PLM change process, CR with CA governed by CO.
				</p>

				<h3>Roles</h3>
				<p>The wind turbine is in need for both improved blades and an improved yaw system. Both these issues
					are raised and, therefore need to go through the PLM process step-by-step to make sure that the
					right people make and approve changes. For this project, the process will be done by four people
					which are assigned different roles. These roles can be seen in the table below.</p>

					<h2>Issues</h2>
				</header>

				<h3>Mark up</h3>
				<p>
					First, an issue is raised by either an engineer, expert or product manager. In this project, the
					issues were raised by the project leader. This process starts in the 3D markup space, where comments
					can be placed on the parts that should be changed. This is helpful as the 3D markup acts as
					reference point for what the exact issue is, and which parts of the product are involved.
					<br>
					In this project 2 separate initial 3D markup’s were created, one for each problem (blade, yaw). The
					3D markups for the blade and yaw can be seen in the images below accompanied with their
					corresponding comments.
				</p>
				<section>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Blade</h4>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Markup blade.png" alt=""></a>
							<p>Comment: Blade shape is not optimal for best wind power/electricity yield. This needs to
								be improved.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<h4>Yaw</h4>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Markup yaw.png" alt=""></a>
							<p>Comment: Yaw is not optimal for smooth turning. Due to this proper orientation is often
								difficult. Therefore the Yaw needs a redesign</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<h3>Creating the issues</h3>
				<p>
					From the 3D markups two issues were raised, one for the blade and another for the yaw. Each of these
					issues is assigned to a corresponding change manager who will manage the comming steps in the change
					process.
				</p>

					<h2>Change Requests</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					For each issue a change request (CR) is created and defined by the corresponding change manager, as can be seen below.

					<div class="col-12 col-12-medium col-12-small">
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/CR blade&yaw.png" alt=""></a>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Impact analysis</h3>
				<p>
					The change manager organizes that impact analysis (IA) and makes sure that the right IA's and files are send to the right experts. These experts are than asked to all give valuable insights on what a possible change could mean for the product and/or company from the perspective of their expertise.  
				</p>

				<h4>Approval routing</h4>
				<p>
					After all impact analysis have been written by experts, the change owner should approve the impact analysis, only based on if all analysis have been written. The project leader has a more in-depth look at the analysis and makes the first decision if the impact of changing the product is worth the risk.
					<br>
					The final approval should come from the manager with the authority to do so. All risks will have to be weighed against the potential benefits. If this is acceptable the CR will be approved by these different parties trought the routing that can be seen below.

				<h3>Gantt chart</h3>
				<p>
					If the CR is approved the project leader will start making a planning for the project. This is done by making a Gantt Chart. In this chart the project leader defines milestones, tasks and the order and dependencies for these milestones and tasks. During the project, the progress is being checked continuously to make sure that no part is lacking. This should be done on time so that there will always be time to repair issues or problems. The initial panning can be seen in the Gantt Chart below.

					<h2>Change Orders</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					The process is now completely approved, and gets started according to the planning. To get started,
					the final step in the set-up process should be done; making a change order. Two change orders are
					made, one for the blade optimalization and one for the yaw system. Both these change orders contain
					design, mechanical and simulation change actions.

				<h3>Approval routing</h3>

				<p>
					After the change actions are executed the change order can be approved using a routing.  These CA’s can be read about in the next section.  
					<br>
					As the CA’s are already approved by relevant experts the CO only needs to be approved by upper management. When the CO is approved the product is released and the CR’s and initial issues can be completed respectively ending the change process and with that the project.

					These change actions are linked to the specific engineer who should perform the task. When the
					engineer is done with its part, it is send for approval to both an expert in the specific domain and
					afterwards to the project lead.
					<br>
					According to the planning, the order of the change actions should first be the design, then
					mechanical and lastly, the simulation. This can however, be changed since the process is an
					iterative process that might need different versions.

				<h3>Revision</h3>

				<p>
					As defined in the scenario the company already has an existing wind turbine released to the market that will undergo the change process. By applying the CA’s a new revision of the changed parts will be made. These revised parts will then be released to the market once the full change process is completed (CO is approved).

					<h2>Change Exectution</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Through this change process the different improvements to the wind turbine blade and yaw were realised. The improvement process to be executed is defined, executed, reviewed and approved by different parties' trough the approval routings of the CA’s, CO’s, CR’s and finally the initial raised issues. The improvements and validations made to the blade and yaw are documented in this section. 
				</p>

				<h3>Blade design</h3>
				<p>
					The main goal of the blade re-design is to make it more efficient, this can be done by optimizing the
					aerodynamics of the blade. The design engineer’s sketch focuses on improving the cross-section of
					the blade, the shape is inspired on a water droplet shape. Since the overall shape of the blade will
					the changed, the connection to the rest of the assembly should be changed as well, this concept is
					also worked out in the sketch.

					<div class="col-12 col-12-medium col-12-small">
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/blade concept design.png" alt=""></a>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Based on the concept design of the blade the nomenclature of the blade section was defined as can be seen in the SOLIDWORKS sketch below. The cord length and pitch angle for the different blade sections was determined using the given values in the course description of the PLM project. These values can be seen in the tables below.  
				</p>

						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<p>
					From the pitch angles and chord lengths the new blade was modelled in SOLIDWORKS. Additionally, the connection piece for the rotor was altered to fit the new rotor blade using a round connection with a key insert to assure the proper orientation of the blade.

				<h3>Blade simulation</h3>

				<p>
					A flow simulation was performed to evaluate the proposed design changes. The simulation was
					initially conducted on the baseline blade design, and these results served as a comparative
					guideline for the simulation of the proposed design. The flow simulation on the proposed design
					revealed a reduction in drag forces and an increase in lift forces. The detailed results, including
					drag and lift coefficients, can be seen in Table ...

						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/old_blade_flow_simulation.png" alt=""></a>
					</div>
				</div>


				<h2>Yaw design</h2>

				<p>
					The yaw system of the current wind turbine gives too much friction, this is an issue due to the wear
					of the metal pieces and losing energy. The new concept from the design engineer shows a possible
					solution by including a bearing in the design. This, so called, thrust bearing is placed between the
					axle and the nacelle to reduce friction that causes by the rotating pieces. The axle has been
					re-designed, to accommodate for the bearing. The length of the axle has increased and the width of
					the flange has been widened, both these changes make sure that the bearing fits on the axle.

						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<h3>Yaw motion study</h3>

				<p>
					A motion study has been performed by the engineer to check if all parts fit and to see if the
					required rotating has been designed as intended. The study shows that the changes, in theory, should
					perform as designed. After the simulation has been approved, the technical drawings can be sent to
					the manufacturer to find out if the changes could also work in practice.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				</header>

				<p>
					Product lifecycle management software, in this case 3Dexperience, has been used during this project.
					The use case of this project is to simulate being a company that has to improve their wind turbine
					to increase the efficiency of the blades and to reduce the friction in the yaw system. This whole
					process is done by using the PLM software to keep track of the planning, the changes and the
					approvals that are needed in a company to perform these changes.
					<br>
					Using this software gave a valuable insight in what it could potentially look like and to understand
					the complete change process. By closely following the proposed PLM process, the project and the
					changes went through all necessary steps and approvals, creating a solid ground to realize changes
					and to streamline the process.
					<br>
					Using a PLM software could, after learning from this experience, prove to be helpful for small and
					medium-sized companies, since the whole process is streamlined and well-organized and being able to
					have all potential tools available in the toolbar. For larger companies, the PLM software should be
					a necessity. Being able to organize, streamline the process will be helpful. The function to only
					show the necessary files and tools feels crucial for large companies, to make sure that employees do
					not get too much or too little information to be able to perform their job of the project. 
				</p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					At first, the chosen software 3Dexperience, seemed like a good fit for both the project and the
					experience from the group since all previously used other software from the same company. However,
					the software seemed to have a steeper learning curve than expected. The process and theory behind
					PLM was explained, but implementing this in this exact PLM software gave some troubles, as expected
					when learning a new software.
					<br>
					The process that was used during this project was based on the process explained during the theory
					part of the course. This process seemed to be beneficial and structured, which helped with project
					management and change management. The small group size of this project caused some group members,
					for example, had to be both CEO and change manager. This means that due to some approval routings,
					the same person had to approve twice for the process to continue. These kind of scenarios will not
					happen during projects in larger companies, but since SMEs could potentially also use the project,
					it might be interesting to see if there is an different routing that these companies take to make
					sure that the approval process does not only go through one person.
					<br>
					During this project different problems were encountered in the change process. One of the main problems has to do with PDM. A lot of problems were encountered with saving, duplicate files and maturity states. This was most likely caused by branching the original product assembly from another space, causing problems with permissions to the files. This problem could have been prevented by downloading the files locally and uploading them to the new space instead of branching them. From these uploaded files the relevant files would be revised during the CA’s. In the end this had to be done this way anyway as the branched parts could not be put into frozen anymore due to lacking permissions.
				</p>

					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium col-12-small">
						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/branching.png" alt=""></a>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Another problem was with the aerodynamics simulations. Due to a lack of knowledge in the field it was unclear whether the new blade was better or worse. This caused a lot of time being spend into figuring out the aerodynamics of the blades while this time have better been spent in the PLM process.
